# JWST AstroVis Project

This project takes raw FITS images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), performs reprojection to a common coordinate system, and generates visually compelling false-color images. 

Final result: [link](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/53658785/preview/53658785/preview.jpg)

## Example Workflow

1. **Download FITS files** from JWST NIRCam or MIRI instruments from the MAST archive here:

2. **Reproject** them to a common WCS 
3. **Scale** the data (log, linear, asinh, etc.) 
4. **Assign channels** (e.g., F444W → Red, F356W → Green, F200W → Blue)
5. **Render and export** the final image
